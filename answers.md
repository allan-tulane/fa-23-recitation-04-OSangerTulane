In this modified compare_sort function, I've added ssort to the list of sorting methods, and I'm comparing all three sorting methods (qsort with fixed pivot, qsort with random pivot, and ssort) on both random and sorted input lists.


This code will give you two sets of results: one for random permutations and one for already sorted permutations. You can then compare the running times and analyze how they relate to the asymptotic bounds for each algorithm. 


- **1c.**
This will provide you with a comparison of your sorting implementations (quicksort or selection sort) and Python's sorted function on both random and sorted input lists.

You can analyze the results to see how your sorting implementations compare to Python's built-in sorting function in terms of performance. Keep in mind that Python's sorted function is highly optimized and uses Timsort, which is expected to perform well in most real-world scenarios.
